You're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you're reaching for the stars
They just cut you down

Looking through the glass
Cannot recognize the ghost that you are seeing
Every step you take on the burning sand
Slowly sinking deeper
All the memories remain all the pain from your broken home
And the walls 'round your heart grew so strong
You can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for stars
They just cut you down
'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

Here they come again
Hear them whispering when your heart is bleeding
Like a symphony playing on repeat
Unravelling your feelings
All the memories remain all the strain, you feel broken up
And the weight that you feel pulls you down
You can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
You keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for stars
They just cut you down
'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

It's an endless war
But then they cut you down
They cut you down once more
Don't let them cut you down
Cut you down once more
